# CopyWebContent
It seems nowadays most of the web pages use a content class node to display the main content of that page! This Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script adds a short-cut (**Ctrl+Shift+C**) to the browser which will copy the rich text version of those contents (directly pastable to a rich text editor with the format, e.g. MS word) to the system clipboard.
